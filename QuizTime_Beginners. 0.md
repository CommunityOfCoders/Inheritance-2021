We can add any number of questions of any subjects. As soon as the answer is clicked , if it is correct --there is a green right mark else the option selected becomes red and the correct answer is diaplayed.

  According to the score , there is a message of appreciation and the score got. There is a dynamic background through out the test which gives a good feeling to the user.

## Usage
> After all set up , we have to click "GO live" (At the bottom right corner of the vscode).If you don't have that there go into extensions and install Live server.
## Applications
> This website can help one to solve a given problem in a particular time limit and builds his/her confidence to face other questions. It is too easy to use this for teachers too.
## Future scope
> We need to work on the backend part as to store the details and score of the all participants and give them an overall progress statistics.
