_**Cookie consent code generator**_, is a website where you can choose the look, style and the animation that you want to your cookie consent banner, after European Union’s data protection law, it is compulsory for websites who are operating in European union in countries like Austria, Belgium and all other countries in union to have a consent of users to track their activity. Our website will have the Radio buttons to select the

- Position of the cookie consent banner.
- Colour combination.
- Animation.
- Content modification.

After selecting the choices website will generate the
CSS and java script code that the user can copy and paste it in its website( we are going to provide a one video tutorial on, where you have to paste the code so anyone without having any prior knowledge of coding can modify his/her website) and after pasting that code in their website. Whenever the user arrives on website. The website will generate the consent banner that their website user can agree or disagree with the activity tracking done by them and with this feature website owners can operate in European Union countries without having any legal issue.

So team _‘Algo Rhythm’_ wants to solve this minor issue raised by the government’s concern about the data privacy. Which can have repercussions on small business that are operating online. With this cookie consent code generator we can help small business to stay away from any unwanted legal issues.
