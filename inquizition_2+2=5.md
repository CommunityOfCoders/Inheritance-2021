## 📝 Description
It is essentially a quiz app with various topics in it. On selecting a particular topic randomly 5 questions will be selected from a pool of questions.
You will get 10 seconds to answer each questions and as time passes by the points you will recieve will decrease. At the end of the quiz you will be able to see your rank on leaderboard.
IF WE HAVE SOME TIME ON OUR HANDS THEN WE WILL TRY TO MAKE IT PVP
Along with this, add the link of the drive folder that contains the app APK/Screenshots/Screen Recordings. If you have hosted your project on the web, add that link as well.
