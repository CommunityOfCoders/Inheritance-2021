> Each and every year due to the rainy season numerous potholes get
> created at various places, this causes lots of accidents to occur.
> This application can be used by local people to inform about the
> potholes (by sharing the location) that are dangerous and need to be
> fixed. This application will send these data to the municipal
> corporation, where the corporation can take actions by filling the
> pothole, or putting a signboard, etc.

>like accepting requests, updating the status of a complaint, etc. This
>status will reflect on the user’s side of the app on the Tracker Page
>which will give him/her real time updates and improve the overall user
>experience.
