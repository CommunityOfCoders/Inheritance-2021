## 🤳 Applications

>Each and every year due to the rainy season numerous potholes get created at various places, this causes lots of accidents to occur. This application can be used by local people to inform about the potholes (by sharing the location) that are dangerous and need to be fixed. This application will send these data to the municipal corporation, where the corporation can take actions by filling the pothole, or putting a signboard, etc.
## 🔮 Future scope

>In the near future, if the app gets approved by some government body, we can develop the admin side of the app giving it more functionalities like accepting requests, updating the status of a complaint, etc. This status will reflect on the user’s side of the app on the Tracker Page which will give him/her real time updates and improve the overall user experience.
