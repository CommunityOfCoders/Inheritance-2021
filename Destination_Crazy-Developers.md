## Web Scrapping
### We use http://www.openculture.com/ for this
```javascript
url = "http://www.openculture.com/"
course_dict = [{},{},{},{}]  #list of 6 dictionaries
sub_url=["computer_science_free_courses","free-online-data-science-courses",
         "math_free_courses","engineering_free_courses"]
csv_files=["computerscience","datascience","math","engineering"]
#extraction of data
for i in range(len(sub_url)):
    course_no = 0
    url_new = url + sub_url[i]
    response = requests.get(url_new)
    data = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')
    contents = soup.find_all("ul")
    for content in contents:
        names = content.find_all("strong")
        for name in names:
            if len(name.text)>=6:
                course_link = []
                course_name = name.text
                courses = name.find_next_siblings("a")
                course_provider = name.find_parent("li").text[len(course_name)+1:]
                count =0
                for course in courses:
                    if count<=3 :
                        course_link.append(course.get('href'))
                        count +=1

                #print(course_no,course_name,course_provider,course_link)
                (course_dict[i])[course_no] = [course_name,course_provider,course_link]
                course_no += 1

            else:
                continue
```
