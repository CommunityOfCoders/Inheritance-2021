# Description

We often tend to forget birthdays,followup messages and important messages to send on particular day.Using this site,you just need to write the messages,choose date on which message has to be send  and save it in database .The message will automatically be send to desired person on desired date.It allows you to add the date of birth and other minimal information to a local database. Then the program will take care of calculating the dates for you.Reminder is a automatic message sending site which enables you to write important messages that are to to sent on a particular date prior.So tha important messages aren’t missed out on the decided dates.The message will automatically send to the desired person on the decided date.
The ML model uses the code and directs the message at 12 am,using the Task Scehdular. 
Used Flask REST API for backend querying of model.
react-force-graph module is used for displaying the data in map format.
HTML/CSS/JS and React are used for building the UI and other features of the websit
